    text: The organizing committee of EuroMPI/USA 2020 is currently evaluating all options to hold the conference in-person,
          virtually, or as a hybrid of the two. No decision has yet been made, however, we will be working in cooperation with
          the local organizing team and monitoring local restrictions and guidelines to determine our plans as the conference approaches.
          Regardless of the format, the organizing team is committed to holding a high-quality conference including an excellent technical
          program.
